# Bucket CMS

Sometimes you don’t want a CMS, you just need a bucket. Bucket CMS is the lightest lightweight CMS around – ready for you to drop into your Next.js project. 

---

## Install

Bucket CMS is meant to be added into your existing Next.js project.

If you wish to start from scratch, begin by using `create-next-app` to [create a new Next.js project](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

```
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Once you have a Next.js project, you can create Bucket CMS inside it:

```
npx create-bucket-cms
```
